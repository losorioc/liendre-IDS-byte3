	<h1>Accountability: About This Data Set</h1></div>
	
	   <div class="page-header"><p>The datasets are the result of running an experiment that uses different activity tracking plugins and sensors using my mobile phone. 
        I got information of mobile screen, battery, and gps. I had to use less information than I was expecting because Apple does not allow to get all the data the application offers.
        For example, activity recognition. Given the data I got was adquired with a particular periodicity, it presented some gaps. I decided to calculate the average data by hour to eliminate outliers and to reduce variability and noise in the data.
        Then I matched battery and location data using the concatenation of day and hour. After this match I had to eliminate the data that didn't match.
        </p></div>
          
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Where did this data come from?</h2>
	<p>The data was retrieved from the AWARE app using SQL. I used battery charge, location and screen data from my cellphone. The problem of this data is that my location is not exacltly accurate because I carried my cellphone most of the time with me,
	but sometimes I forgot my mobile at home while being in a different place. So, I got the data based on my cellphone location as a proxy of my routine.
	</p>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Who has access to it?</h2>
	<p>Only I can get the raw data, however, the data that I uploaded to Tableau is public.</p>
